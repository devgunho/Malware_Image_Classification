#### IMG Converter - mini project [PyQt]

A small project to show files in gray-scale.

Pyqt was used for implementation.

Specifying a specific directory generates files that have converted all files in that directory into images.

#### (2011) Malware_Images-Visualization_and_Automatic_Classification - University of California

We propose a simple yet effective method for visualizing and classifying malware using image processing techniques.

Malware binaries are visualized as gray-scale images, with the observation that for many malware families, the images belonging to the same family appear very similar in layout and texture.

Motivated by this visual similarity, a classification method using standard image features is proposed.

Neither disassembly nor code execution is required for classification.

Preliminary experimental results are quite promising with 98% classification accuracy on a malware database of 9,458 samples with 25 different malware families.

Our technique also exhibits interesting resilience to popular obfuscation techniques such as section encryption.
